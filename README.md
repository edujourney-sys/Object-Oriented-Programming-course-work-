# Object-Oriented-Programming-course-work-
This project features four Java programs that demonstrate key programming concepts such as OOP, loops, arrays, file handling, and GUI design. The systems include a Grade Calculator, Grade Summary, SK Motors Auction, and a Student Registration application, each designed to perform specific tasks efficiently while showcasing both console-based and graphical Java applications.
The "Problem & Solution"
School Grading: Two programs that automatically turn student scores into grades and summarize the results for a whole class.

Business Sales: An auction system that finds the highest bidder for a vehicle and calculates if the business made money or lost money.

Data Entry: A digital registration form with a window interface (GUI) that checks for mistakes and stores student info safely.
